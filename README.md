# Frequecny_Control_Optimization
This repository includes MATLAB Simulink files to show load changes in power systems and their effects. It features Particle Swarm Optimization-based PI, PID, and Gradient Descent-based Adaptive-PID controllers. For more details, read my article at https://doi.org/10.3390/su16135735.
 Zeigler-Nichols tuning method of both controllers is also added.
