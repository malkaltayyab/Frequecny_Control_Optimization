# Frequecny_Control_Optimization
This repository includes MATLAB Simulink files to show load changes in power systems and their effects.
It features Particle Swarm Optimization-based PI, PID, and Gradient Descent-based Adaptive-PID controllers. 
Zeigler-Nichols tuning method of both controllers is also added.
This work was performed in MATLAB R2021A version 9.10.0. Ensure you use this version or import the files to it. When working with the Objective C source files (.m), run the Simulink files (.slx) first. The system is optimally tuned, but if you make changes, you may need to retune it using the PSO.m file.
